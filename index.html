<p>Buy, sell, and transfer <a href="http://bitcoin.org/en/">bitcoin</a> instantly in your
terminal!  (Powered by <a href="https://coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a>.)</p>

<h2>Why Coinbase?</h2>

<p><a href="https://coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a> is a great bitcoin exchange because:</p>

<ul>
<li>They allow you to immediately add and verify a US bank account (this allows
you to easily purchase and sell bitcoin without the hassle that other
providers make you go through).</li>
<li>They have a clean, simple website that makes using bitcoin a nice experience.</li>
<li>They are backed by an incredible team of investors (see:
<a href="https://coinbase.com/about">https://coinbase.com/about</a>).</li>
</ul><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: I am in no way affiliated with Coinbase.  I don't know anyone that
works there, have no relationship with the investing companies -- nothing.</p>

<h2>Why btc?</h2>

<p>I spend a lot of my time at the terminal, and I greatly prefer using the command
line to buy, sell, and transfer bitcoin as it's a lot quicker than opening web
pages, navigating around, etc.</p>

<p>Using <a href="https://coinbase.com/api/doc">Coinbase's API</a> was a logical next step for
me, as I could do everything I'd normally do through coinbase through a simple
CLI tool, <code>btc</code>.</p>

<p>Why should you use <code>btc</code>?  You should use <code>btc</code> if:</p>

<ul>
<li>You frequently buy / sell / transfer bitcoin.</li>
<li>You use Coinbase.</li>
<li>You prefer to use open source software to ensure your bitcoin are safe (anyone
can view this project code).</li>
</ul><h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>Before using <code>btc</code>, there are a few things you should already have setup.</p>

<ol>
<li>You should be familiar with bitcoin...  <em>Duh!</em>
</li>
<li>You should have a coinbase account.  If you don't, you can create one here:
<a href="https://coinbase.com/">https://coinbase.com/</a>
</li>
<li>You should add a valid US bank account to your coinbase account if you plan
on purchasing or selling bitcoin.  If you only plan on using <code>btc</code> to
transfer bitcoin from one account to another, this is not necessary.</li>
<li>You should create a coinbase API key.  This is what you will need below so
that the <code>btc</code> program knows how to access your account.  You can do this
here: <a href="https://coinbase.com/account/integrations">https://coinbase.com/account/integrations</a>
</li>
</ol><h2>Installation</h2>

<p>You can install <code>btc</code> via <a href="http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">pip</a>:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo pip install btc
</pre></div>

<p>Once <code>btc</code> has been installed, you'll need to give it your coinbase API key so
it knows how to make requests.  You can find your coinbase API key here:
<a href="https://coinbase.com/account/integrations">https://coinbase.com/account/integrations</a> (make sure your API key is
<em>enabled</em>).</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>btc init
</pre></div>

<p>The <code>init</code> command will ask you for input, and walk you through the making sure
that <code>btc</code> is working properly.  Your API key will be stored in a file named
<code>~/.btc</code> in your home directory.  To remove your API key from <code>btc</code>, simply
delete that file.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>If you simply run <code>btc</code> on the command line, you'll get a list of help.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>btc init      <span class="c"># activate btc by supplying your coinbase API key</span>

<p>All commands that have side effects will prompt you for confirmation before
doing anything for added security (so you don't accidentally spend tons of
money, or something).</p>
