## Usage

If you simply run `btc` on the command line, you'll get a list of help.

```bash
$ btc logs      # list your coinbase transactions
$ btc view      # list current buy / sell rates
$ btc buy 1     # purchase 1 bitcoin using your bank account on file
$ btc sell 1    # sell 1 bitcoin
$ btc transfer 1 <someaddress>
                # transfer 1 bitcoin to the specified address
```

All of the commands above (except the `logs` and `view` commands) require you to
manually accept (by pressing `y` or `n` on your keyboard), for added security
(so you don't accidentally spend tons of money, or something).
