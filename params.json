(Powered by [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com/).)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why Coinbase?\r\n\r\n[Coinbase](https://coinbase.com/) is a great bitcoin exchange because:\r\n\r\n- They allow you to immediately add and verify a US bank account (this allows\r\n  you to easily purchase and sell bitcoin without the hassle that other\r\n  providers make you go through).\r\n- They have a clean, simple website that makes using bitcoin a nice experience.\r\n- They are backed by an incredible team of investors (see:\r\n  https://coinbase.com/about).\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: I am in no way affiliated with Coinbase.  I don't know anyone that\r\nworks there, have no relationship with the investing companies -- nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why btc?\r\n\r\nI spend a lot of my time at the terminal, and I greatly prefer using the command\r\nline to buy, sell, and transfer bitcoin as it's a lot quicker than opening web\r\npages, navigating around, etc.\r\n\r\nUsing [Coinbase's API](https://coinbase.com/api/doc) was a logical next step for\r\nme, as I could do everything I'd normally do through coinbase through a simple\r\nCLI tool, `btc`.\r\n\r\nWhy should you use `btc`?  You should use `btc` if:\r\n\r\n- You frequently buy / sell / transfer bitcoin.\r\n- You use Coinbase.\r\n- You prefer to use open source software to ensure your bitcoin are safe (anyone\r\n  can view this project code).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\nBefore using `btc`, there are a few things you should already have setup.\r\n\r\n1. You should be familiar with bitcoin...  *Duh!*\r\n2. You should have a coinbase account.  If you don't, you can create one here:\r\n   https://coinbase.com/\r\n3. You should add a valid US bank account to your coinbase account if you plan\r\n   on purchasing or selling bitcoin.  If you only plan on using `btc` to\r\n   transfer bitcoin from one account to another, this is not necessary.\r\n4. You should create a coinbase API key.  This is what you will need below so\r\n   that the `btc` program knows how to access your account.  You can do this\r\n   here: https://coinbase.com/account/integrations\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nYou can install `btc` via [pip](http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/):\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ sudo pip install btc\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce `btc` has been installed, you'll need to give it your coinbase API key so\r\nit knows how to make requests.  You can find your coinbase API key here:\r\nhttps://coinbase.com/account/integrations (make sure your API key is\r\n*enabled*).\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ btc init\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `init` command will ask you for input, and walk you through the making sure\r\nthat `btc` is working properly.  Your API key will be stored in a file named\r\n`~/.btc` in your home directory.  To remove your API key from `btc`, simply\r\ndelete that file.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nIf you simply run `btc` on the command line, you'll get a list of help.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ btc init      # activate btc by supplying your coinbase API key\r\n$ btc address   # list your active bitcoin address for receiving money\r\n$ btc balance   # list your account balance\r\n$ btc request <btc> <email> [<note>]\r\n                # send a payment request to the specified email address\r\n$ btc send <btc> (<email> | <address>) [<note>]\r\n                # send bitcoin to a person by email address or bitcoin address\r\n$ btc test      # test your API key\r\n$ btc logs      # display a list of recent transaction logs\r\n$ btc rates     # show current exchange rates\r\n$ btc buy 1.5   # purchase 1.5 bitcoin using your bank account on file\r\n$ btc sell 1.5  # sell 1.5 bitcoin\r\n$ btc -h        # display help information\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll commands that have side effects will prompt you for confirmation before\r\ndoing anything for added security (so you don't accidentally spend tons of\r\nmoney, or something).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nv0.3: 04-18-2013\r\n\r\n    - Setting ~/.btc to mode 0600 for additional security.\r\n\r\nv0.2: 04-17-2013\r\n\r\n    - Fixing some small documentation issues.\r\n\r\nv0.1: 04-17-2013\r\n\r\n    - First release!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Like This?\r\n\r\nIf you've enjoyed using `btc`, feel free to send me some bitcoin!
